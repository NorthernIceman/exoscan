12.07.: 
    reworked model to accept forward references
    added security-groups to model security-group-rules because it can be chosen instead of networks
    removed possible error if network = null in security-models. (split())
    added control compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_risky_ports
    reworked Output system, so not every port or every rule generates one message, extendet to other controls in security_groups
    added compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_mgmt_ports
    added compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_database_ports
    added compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_kibana_and_elastic_ports

13.07.: 
    added compute_security_groups_unused_group
    reworked models.py so Optional[] is used and Fields are correctly parsed
    added compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_kerberos_ldap_ports
    added compute_ssh_keys_unused
    added inventory file for ssh-keys (api-response also different from others)

14.07.:
    missed something with models.py
    added compute_ssh_keys_old_keys
    fixed inventory for instances, they seem to have changed all api-responses. 
    added compute_public_instance_unrestricted_ingress
    fixed some issues with older controls 

15.07.:
    added compute_public_instance_ingress_risky_ports
    redid output in all controls until now (much work, very wow)
    added compute_instance_public_ingress_database_ports
    added compute_instance_public_ingress_kerberos_ldap_ports
    added compute_instance_public_ingress_kibana_and_elastic_ports
    added compute_instance_public_ingress_mgmt_ports
    split compute_instance_unrestricted_ingress to quad_zero and all_ports
    added compute_instance_majority_in_same_zone
    added compute_instance_large_instance_type
    added new region (yay)

17.07.:
    refactored instance-inventory function
    added instance-type inventory function and made compute_instance_large_instance_type functional
    added inventory function for templates
    added compute_instance_outdated_template_used
