12.07.: 
    reworked model to accept forward references
    added security-groups to model security-group-rules because it can be chosen instead of networks
    removed possible error if network = null in security-models. (split())
    added control compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_risky_ports
    reworked Output system, so not every port or every rule generates one message, extendet to other controls in security_groups
    added compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_mgmt_ports
    added compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_database_ports
    added compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_kibana_and_elastic_ports

13.07.: 
    added compute_security_groups_unused_group
    reworked models.py so Optional[] is used and Fields are correctly parsed
    added compute_security_groups_allow_ingress_from_internet_to_kerberos_ldap_ports
    added compute_ssh_keys_unused
    added inventory file for ssh-keys (api-response also different from others)

14.07.:
    missed something with models.py
    added compute_ssh_keys_old_keys
    fixed inventory for instances, they seem to have changed all api-responses. 
    added compute_public_instance_unrestricted_ingress
    fixed some issues with older controls 

15.07.:
    added compute_public_instance_ingress_risky_ports
    redid output in all controls until now (much work, very wow)
    added compute_instance_public_ingress_database_ports
    added compute_instance_public_ingress_kerberos_ldap_ports
    added compute_instance_public_ingress_kibana_and_elastic_ports
    added compute_instance_public_ingress_mgmt_ports
    split compute_instance_unrestricted_ingress to quad_zero and all_ports
    added compute_instance_majority_in_same_zone
    added compute_instance_large_instance_type
    added new region (yay)

17.07.:
    refactored instance-inventory function
    added instance-type inventory function and made compute_instance_large_instance_type functional
    added inventory function for templates
    added compute_instance_outdated_template_used

21.07.: 
    added compute_instance_unreachable
    added compute_instance_no_anti_affinity_group
    defined controls for instance_pools
    altered inventory for instances so they include details again 
    added inventory.py for instance_pools
    altered gitignore
    added compute_instance_pool_instances_state_not_running
    added compute_instance_pool_instances_different_template
    added compute_instance_pool_instances_different_type

22.07.:
    added sks inventory and model and fixed errors that came with that
    added compute_sks_auto_update_disabled
    added compute_sks_version_outdated
    redid some things with inventory for templates, scrapped template control because unnecessary
    added elastic-ips model and inventory
    added compute_eip_shodan

23.7.:
    added compute_eip_unused
    added load_balancer models and inventory
    added compute_load_balancer_security_group_blocks_health_check
    added compute_load_balancer_security_health_check_fails
    added blockstorage snapshot and volume models and inventory-functions
    added compute_block_storage_unused_volume
    added compute_block_storage_no_snapshots
    added private network model and inventory Fields
    added compute_private_networks_leases_reach_threshold
    altered gitignore
    module compute is now complete (yay)

24.7.:
    added inventory and models for buckets
    figured out how to get acls and cors rules from buckets.
    added storage_buckets_acl_full_control_AllUsers
    extend models to parse CORS, object lock (bool) and versioning (bool)
    added storage_buckets_versioning_enabled
    added storage_buckets_cors_unrestricted_wildcard
